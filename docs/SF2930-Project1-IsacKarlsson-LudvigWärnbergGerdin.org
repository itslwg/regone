*** Normality of residuals
    
    Figure [[fig:qqplot]] illustrates QQ plot of the model residuals. The observer may say that the 
    points exhibit a pattern that indicates that the residuals come from a distribution with heavier tails
    than that of a normal distribution. 
    \cite{Montgomery2012}. Still, the deviations from the diagonal line is relatively small, and hence
    we conclude that the first Gauss-Markov condition is fulfilled. That is, the model errors seem to be 
    normally distributed.

*** Fitted Against Residuals
    
    Figure [[fig:far]] illustrates the fitted values $\hat y_j$ against the R-student residuals. No apparent 
    pattern is formed by the points, i.e. the points seem to be randomly scattered along the horizontal line.
    Hence we conclude that the second Gauss-Markov condition is fulfilled, that is the errors have a constant 
    variance.

*** Added Variable Analysis
   
   Partial regression plots are found in figure [[fig:biceps_forearm_wrist_av]], [[fig:thigh_knee_ankle_av]],
   [[fig:age_weight_height_neck]], and [[fig:chest_abdomen_hip_av]]. All figures exhibits potential outliers 
   (which will be further considered in section [[Diagnostics and handling of Outliers]]).
   More specifically, in figure [[fig:biceps_forearm_wrist_av]] we note a 
   few potential outliers on the right hand side of the plot for the \texttt{biceps} regressor, and on the
   right and left hand side for the \texttt{forearm} regressor. Moreover, in figure [[fig:thigh_knee_ankle_av]], we 
   notice outliers on the right hand side of the \texttt{ankle} plot, and a group of potential outliers on the
   \texttt{thigh} plot. Finally, we notice a few potential outliers in figure [[fig:age_weight_height_neck]] and 
   [[fig:chest_abdomen_hip_av]].
  
   Figure [[fig:thigh_knee_ankle_av]], [[fig:age_weight_height_neck]], and [[fig:chest_abdomen_hip_av]] 
   conveys important information about the information that \texttt{knee}, \texttt{height}, and
   \texttt{chest} adds to the model. These regressors seem to follow a horizontal band along a fitted 
   line from the origin, which may suggest that none of the regressors adds additional information 
   to the predictions.

** Transformations of variables
   
   Figure [[fig:boxcox]] displays the values of $\lambda$ to be used in a potential Box-Cox transformation of 
   the dependent variable \texttt{density}. The $\lambda$ that maximized the log-likelihood is 0.9 (0.7-1.1 95% CI). 

   Using $\lambda = 0.9$ gives us the normal probability plot displayed on the right hand side in f
