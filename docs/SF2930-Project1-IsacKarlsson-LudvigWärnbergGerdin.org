** Residual analysis
*** Normality of residuals

    The normality of residuals therefore ensures that the confidence intervals presented in section [[Results]]
    are valid.

*** Normality of residuals
    
    Figure [[fig:qqplot]] illustrates QQ plot of the model residuals. The observer may say that the 
    points exhibit a pattern that indicates that the residuals come from a distribution with heavier tails
    than that of a normal distribution. 
    \cite{Montgomery2012}. Still, the deviations from the diagonal line is relatively small, and hence
    we conclude that the first Gauss-Markov condition is fulfilled. That is, the model errors seem to be 
    normally distributed.

*** Fitted Against Residuals
    
    Figure [[fig:far]] illustrates the fitted values $\hat y_j$ against the R-student residuals. No apparent 
    pattern is formed by the points, i.e. the points seem to be randomly scattered along the horizontal line.
    Hence we conclude that the second Gauss-Markov condition is fulfilled, that is the errors have a constant 
    variance.

*** Added Variable Analysis
   
   Partial regression plots are found in figure [[fig:biceps_forearm_wrist_av]], [[fig:thigh_knee_ankle_av]],
   [[fig:age_weight_height_neck]], and [[fig:chest_abdomen_hip_av]]. All figures exhibits potential outliers 
   (which will be further considered in section [[Diagnostics and handling of Outliers]]).
   More specifically, in figure [[fig:biceps_forearm_wrist_av]] we note a 
   few potential outliers on the right hand side of the plot for the \texttt{biceps} regressor, and on the
   right and left hand side for the \texttt{forearm} regressor. Moreover, in figure [[fig:thigh_knee_ankle_av]], we 
   notice outliers on the right hand side of the \texttt{ankle} plot, and a group of potential outliers on the
   \texttt{thigh} plot. Finally, we notice a few potential outliers in figure [[fig:age_weight_height_neck]] and 
   [[fig:chest_abdomen_hip_av]].
  
   Figure [[fig:thigh_knee_ankle_av]], [[fig:age_weight_height_neck]], and [[fig:chest_abdomen_hip_av]] 
   conveys important information about the information that \texttt{knee}, \texttt{height}, and
   \texttt{chest} adds to the model. These regressors seem to follow a horizontal band along a fitted 
   line from the origin, which may suggest that none of the regressors adds additional information 
   to the predictions.

** Transformations of variables
   
   Figure [[fig:boxcox_fit]] displays the values of $\lambda$ to be used in a potential Box-Cox transformation of 
   the dependent variable \texttt{density}. The $\lambda$ that maximized the log-likelihood is 0.9 (0.7-1.1 95% CI). 

   Using $\lambda = 0.9$ gives us the normal probability plot displayed on the right hand side in figure [[fig:boxcox_fit]].
   We notice that this affects the distribution of residuals by making it more light-tailed. That is, the 
   the tails of the distribution are too light for the distribution to be considered normal.

   In section [[Residual analysis]] we noted that there was no indication that a transformation was needed. 
   Here, we see that the transformation of the response variable only makes matters worse.

** Diagnostics and handling of Outliers
   
   Figure [[fig:cd]] illustrates Cook's distance for all points, where the three observations with the largest 
   Cook's distance are labelled.

   #+CAPTION: Plot of Cook's distance for all observations.
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm :placement [h]
   [[~/courses/Regression Analysis/regone/cd.png]]

   Figure [[fig:dffits]] reports the $DFFITS$ values. We label observations as in figure [[fig:cd]]. We observe 
   that the three largest absolute $DFFITS$ correspond to the same observations as in the Cook's distance plot.

   Figure [[fig:biceps_forearm_wrist_dfbeta]], [[fig:age_weight_height_neck_dfbeta]], [[fig:thigh_knee_ankle_dfbeta]], and
   [[fig:chest_abdomen_hip_dfbeta]] presents $DFBETA$ values for groups of regressors. Observation 39
   is present in a number of these figures.
